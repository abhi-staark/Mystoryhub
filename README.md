# Mystoryhub
This repository contains the source code for a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter. The app retrieves and displays albums and posts for a user from various API endpoints. It is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.

**Features:**

**Homepage:** Displays user profile with an option to upload a photo or take a selfie using the camera. Also, shows the user's location.
**Album Detail View:** Presents albums in a grid view with two items per row. Each album is represented by a box with a folder icon and title. Tapping on an album navigates to a detailed view with photos associated with that album.
**My Posts Section:** Displays posts retrieved from the Posts API for the user. Each post shows the title and body, and tapping on a post opens a detailed view with comments.
**Shared Elements:** Ensures a consistent and visually appealing UI across the entire application with proper navigation between different sections.
**Offline Handling:** Implements offline data handling, allowing users to view previously fetched data even without an internet connection.
**Code Quality:** It follows Flutter best practices and adheres to the Flutter style guide.
This repository serves as a demonstration of building a Flutter application with features such as API integration, offline support, and UI design. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or reach out to the project maintainers.
